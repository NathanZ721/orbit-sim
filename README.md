Orbit simulation

Instructions for running simulator:

enter masses and initial positions and velocities of all bodies
adjust time step (higher time step results in less accuracy but runs faster)
adjust number of steps per plot point (higher number runs faster but has results in less smooth animation)
run simulation

Instructions for using sliders:

select a body using the "planet" slider
adjust the mass using the M slider, adjust each component of velocity using vx, vy, vz sliders
adjust time step using the slider on the far right
